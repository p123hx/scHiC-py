Introduction
============

A computational toolbox for analyzing single cell Hi-C (high-throughput sequencing for 3C) data which includes functions for:

1. Loading single-cell HiC datasets
2. Screening valid single-cell data.
3. Smoothing the contact maps with linear convolution, random walk or network enhancing
4. Calculating pairwise similarity using measures include InnerProduct, HiCRep and Selfish
5. Calculating embeddings for single cell HiC datasets efficiently with MDS, t-SNE and PHATE
6. Clustering the cells using scHiCluster, k-means and spectral clustering.
7. Visualizing embedded cells via 2-D or 3-D scatter plot.
